## Bonus Features: 

- The double jump feature was implemented with jumpCount, which gets incremented when the player jumps. If the player has jumped twice, they won't be able to jump again
- The dash feature was implemented the same way the ball was launched in Studio 2, but a cooldown was added so the player doesn't spam the shift button and get launched too far
- The cooldown was implemented with a coroutine and the WaitForSeconds function.
